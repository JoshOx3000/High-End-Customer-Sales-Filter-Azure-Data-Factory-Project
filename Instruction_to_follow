Absolutely! Here's a clear and logical step-by-step guide for users to follow in Azure Data Factory to build a pipeline that **filters high-end customers** (where `TotalAmount > 1000`) from a CSV in one container and moves the filtered data to another container.

---

## 🧭 Logical Steps to Create the ADF Pipeline for High-End Customer Filter

### 🪜 **Step 1: Set Up Azure Blob Storage**

1. **Upload your source file** (e.g., `sales_data.csv`) to a container named `sales-data`.
2. **Create a destination container** named `high-end-customers` (if it doesn’t exist).

---

### 🪜 **Step 2: Create the ADF Pipeline**

1. **Go to Azure Data Factory Studio**

   * Open your Azure Data Factory instance.
   * Click on **Author & Monitor** to launch the ADF studio.

---

### 🪜 **Step 3: Create Linked Services**

1. In **Manage** (gear icon on the left):

   * Add a **Linked Service** to your Azure Blob Storage.

---

### 🪜 **Step 4: Create Datasets**

1. **Source Dataset** (DelimitedText):

   * Linked to `sales-data` container.
   * Point to `sales_data.csv`.
   * Ensure first row is header and columns like `TotalAmount` are correctly mapped.

2. **Sink Dataset** (DelimitedText):

   * Linked to `high-end-customers` container.
   * Output file: `high_value_customers.csv`.

---

### 🪜 **Step 5: Create a Data Flow**

1. Go to the **Data Flows** section and create a new one.

2. Add a **Source**:

   * Connect to your source dataset (`sales_data.csv`).
   * Import schema.

3. Add a **Derived Column** (if `TotalAmount` is a string):

   * Name: `totalAmountInt`
   * Expression:

     ```sql
     toInteger(TotalAmount)
     ```

4. Add a **Filter** transformation:

   * Expression builder:

     ```
     tointeger(totalAmountInt) > 1000
     ```

5. Add a **Sink**:

   * Connect to the output dataset (`high_value_customers.csv`).
   * Set sink type as "Single file" or "Output to folder" as needed.

---

### 🪜 **Step 6: Create a Pipeline and Add the Data Flow**

1. Create a new pipeline.
2. Drag and drop the **Data Flow activity**.
3. Select the Data Flow you just created.
4. Debug to test it.

---

### 🪜 **Step 7: Trigger the Pipeline**

* You can **manually trigger**, schedule it, or use event-based triggers (e.g., when a file lands in `sales-data`).

---

### ✅ Output

A new file `high_value_customers.csv` is generated in the `high-end-customers` container with only the customers whose `TotalAmount > 1000`.
